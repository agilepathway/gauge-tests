Step Refactoring through command
================================

tags: refactoring

* Initialize a project named "spec_refactoring_thru_cmd" without example spec
* Create a scenario "Sample scenario" in specification "Basic spec execution" with the following steps unimplemented 

   |step text               |
   |------------------------|
   |First step              |
   |Second step             |
   |Repeated First step     |
   |Step with "two" "params"|

* Create a scenario "Sample scenario2" in specification "Basic spec execution2" with the following steps with implementation 

   |step text                  |implementation      |
   |---------------------------|--------------------|
   |First step                 |"inside first step" |
   |Step with "two" "params"   |"inside first step" |
   |a step with "a" "b" and "c"|"inside first step" |
   |Second step                |"inside second step"|
   |step1                      |"inside step1"      |

Should not refactor alias steps
-------------------------------

tags: java, csharp, ruby, python, js

* Create step implementations

   |step text            |implementation|
   |---------------------|--------------|
   |[alias one,alias two]|"inside alias"|

* Create a scenario "Sample scenario2" in specification "Basic spec execution" with the following steps with implementation 

   |step text|
   |---------|
   |alias one|

* Step with alias "alias one" to "alais one more" cannot be refactored 

   |step name|
   |---------|
   |alias one|
   |alias two|

Rename step
-----------

tags: java, csharp, ruby, python, js

* Refactor step "First step" to "New step"
* The step "First step" should no longer be used
* The step "New step" should be used in project
* Execute the spec "Basic spec execution2" and ensure success

Rephrase simple step
--------------------

tags: java, csharp, ruby, python, js

* Refactor step "Step with <a> <b>" to "Step having <b> and <a>"
* The step "Step with \"two\" \"params\"" should no longer be used
* The step "Step having \"params\" and \"two\"" should be used in project
* Execute the spec "Basic spec execution2" and ensure success

Rephrase step having new parameters
-----------------------------------

tags: java, csharp, ruby, python, js

* Refactor step "Step with <a> <b>" to "Step having <b> <c> and <a>"
* The step "Step with \"two\" \"params\"" should no longer be used
* The step "Step having \"params\" \"c\" and \"two\"" should be used in project
* Execute the spec "Basic spec execution2" and ensure success

Rephrase step removing parameters
---------------------------------

tags: java, csharp, ruby, python, js

* Refactor step "Step with <a> <b>" to "Step having <b> and <c>"
* The step "Step with \"two\" \"params\"" should no longer be used
* The step "Step having \"params\" and \"c\"" should be used in project
* Execute the spec "Basic spec execution2" and ensure success

Rephrase step with all new parameters
-------------------------------------

tags: java, csharp, ruby, python, js

* Refactor step "Step with <a> <b>" to "Step having <d> and <c>"
* The step "Step with \"two\" \"params\"" should no longer be used
* The step "Step having \"d\" and \"c\"" should be used in project
* Execute the spec "Basic spec execution2" and ensure success

Refactor a non-Existing step
----------------------------

tags: java, csharp, ruby, python, js

* Refactor step "hello" to "world"
* The error message <file:resources/refactor_console.txt> should be displayed on console

Rename an unimplemented step
----------------------------

tags: java, csharp, ruby, python, js

* Refactor step "Repeated First step" to "again Repeated First step"
* The step "Repeated First step" should no longer be used
* The step "again Repeated First step" should be used in project

Rename step to step with \
--------------------------

tags: java, js

* Refactor step "step1" to "step with \\ slash"
* The step "step1" should no longer be used
* The step "step with \\ slash" should be used in project
* Execute the spec "Basic spec execution2" and ensure success

Rename in teardown
------------------

tags: java, csharp, ruby, python, js

* Add the following teardown steps in specification "Basic spec execution2"

   |step text      |implementation          |
   |---------------|------------------------|
   |First teardown |"inside first teardown" |
   |Second teardown|"inside second teardown"|

* Refactor step "First teardown" to "First \"b\" teardown"
* The step "First \"b\" teardown" should be used in project
* The step "First teardown" should no longer be used
* Execute the spec "Basic spec execution2" and ensure success
